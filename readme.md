## Sandboxes

Where I fiddle around with different libraries to see what's best.
* `test-stock-price-api`: scratch code to GET from Alpha Vantage stock price API
* `test-victory`: initially tried the `victory` library, but could never get it too work (didn't display properly). Final form in there uses `react-charts-js2`, which I'm rather afraid of because it doesn't look very well-supported, and doesn't have good documentation.
* `test-d3-react`: D3 inside reactJS.
